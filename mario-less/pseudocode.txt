1. Initialize the variable height
2. Use do while loop to get a value of height between 1 and 8, from the user
3. Prompt user for height using get_int
4. Call the function and pass height to it as a parameter

5. Declare a function called buildPyramid that takes (int height) as parameter
    Use for loop to iterate from 1 through height value with the following condtion:
    for (int i = 0; i < height; i++)
    On iteration i, print i newline
    Use nested loop(int k = height - i; k > 1; k--)
    On iteration k, print empty space " "
    Use second nested loop still in i (int j = 0; j <= i; j++)
    On iteration j, print hashes
    Finally print new line
